# Introduction: Weather Data Analysis
Weather refers to short-term atmospheric conditions of a region and can include indicators such as minimum/maximum temperature, humidity, or wind speed. Climate is the weather of a region averaged over a long period of time. Climate data covers details such as seasonal average temperatures or decade-long patterns of rains and contributes to climate prediction.

Weather data provides information about the weather and climate of a region. It tracks patterns and predicts trends.

Weather analysis begins with the observation and administration of the current state of the atmosphere, ocean, and land surface. Thus, many platforms, including satellites, radar, weather balloons, surface stations, and aircraft (both crewed and uncrewed) are crucial for generating reliable observations from accurate analyses.

Weather data is tremendously important to agriculture and infrastructure planning. Various industries use weather data for real-world business cases, such as travel planning, demand forecast, and supply chain management. The easy availability of weather data for practically any region makes it possible to incorporate it in diverse analytical cases.

## Objective
The major objective of this Exploratory Data Analysis by Visualization is to examine historical weather data to extract insights and patterns, which include analyzing Temperature trends, Weather patterns, Wind speeds frequency, Relative Humidity and more.

## The Key Analysis Components
**Frequency Distribution:** This is conducted to observe and juxtapose the weather factor frequencies for each period of the year, especially when intensifying and when it is less pressurizing.

**Weather Situation:** This is conducted to reveal and study each weather/atmospheric situation with respect to the temperature and relative humidity as regards specific period/month of the year in order to mitigate the defaults that arises as the weather situation changes each period.

## Conclusion
The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the weather dataset unveiled several significant insights into the atmospheric conditions over the specified period. Through a combination of juxtapositions, measurements and visualizations, we have gained a deeper understanding of different weather patterns each with respect to its responsible factor.
Also, about the Weather temporal patterns; the temperature analysis shows the variance in temperate range with respect to a given period (month) of the year which in the long run alters the relative humidity, as well the weather atmospheric situation at each given period, thus allowing us to identify the frequency and duration of specific atmospheric states.
Instances of cloudy/clear skies, snowy conditions and foggy weather patterns were explored, thereby enhancing our ability to anticipate and prepare for specific weather phenomena, contributing to improved decision-making.

## Implication
Weather Data Analysis are important because they are used to protect lives and property by deriving forecasts. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to traders within commodity markets.
Also, Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days, supply chain management and customer demand planning â€” to ensure that the right product is at the right place at the right time.

## Limitation
The atmospheric system, Unlike the tides and the orbit of planets, has an intrinsic limit that represents a natural and ultimate boundary beyond which prediction is no longer possible. Also, weather forecasting relies on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models that simulate the atmosphere's behavior based on mathematical equations. However, these models have limitations in representing small-scale features, such as local wind patterns, precipitation, and atmospheric turbulence.
